## 🧩 Project Workflow & Key Deliverables

### 1️⃣ Problem Statement
A retail company wants to better understand its customers’ shopping behavior in order to improve sales performance, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty.

The management team has observed shifts in purchasing patterns across customer demographics, product categories, and behavioral factors such as subscriptions, discounts, and shipping preferences. They are particularly interested in identifying which factors influence customer decisions and repeat purchases.

**Primary Business Question**
> *How can consumer shopping data be leveraged to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?*

This project addresses the problem by analyzing customer behavior data through Python-based exploration, SQL-driven business analysis, and interactive visualization.
